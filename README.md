Twitter crawling code using Twitter4j API

1. Import the twitter4j libraries in your java environment.
2. Generate your own oAuth keys.
3. The code is trying to write data into a file known as output.txt and creates user output files.Look for output over there.
4. This is an extremely naive piece of code. First attempt on twitter. Excuse the bad syntax and coding practice followed.
